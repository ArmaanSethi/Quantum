#### Phys 521: Applications of Quantum Mechanics

Emphasizes atomic physics but includes topics from nuclear, solid state, and particle physics, such as energy levels, the periodic system, selection rules, and fundamentals of spectroscopy.

### Introduction (from final report)
Richard P. Feynman once said, "[Quantum mechanics] describes nature as absurd from the point of view of common sense. And yet it fully agrees with experiment. So I hope you can accept nature as She is - absurd." [9] Quantum mechanics is one of the most precisely tested theories in the history of science. Even though the world around us is described by quantum mechanics, it is incredibly difficult to model any large quantum mechanical system. However, we know that quantum mechanics can easily model classical mechanics because when we look around, that's how we perceive the world. This begs the question about the possibilities of computing using the properties of quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics has many special properties that can be mathematically manipulated in specic ways to compute things that would be nearly impossible to compute otherwise.
